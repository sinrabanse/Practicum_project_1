# Practicum_project_1
My first project from Practicum course

What was used in the project: Python, Jupyter notebook. Libraries: pandas.

Project Description

In this project, I'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. I'll look at real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.

# Hypotheses
1) User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2) On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3) Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

# Description of the data

## Description of columns:
'userID' — user identifier

'Track' — track title

'artist' — artist's name

'City' — user's city
